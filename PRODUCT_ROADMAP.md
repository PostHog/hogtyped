# Product Roadmap

This document outlines the strategic product vision and development roadmap for HogTyped.

## Vision

**Make PostHog analytics type-safe, scalable, and delightful for developers.**

HogTyped transforms the PostHog analytics experience by:
- **Type Safety**: Catch analytics bugs at compile time, not in production
- **Schema-First**: Single source of truth for event definitions across teams
- **Zero Runtime Overhead**: All schemas embedded at build time
- **Multi-Language**: Consistent experience across TypeScript and Python
- **Developer-Friendly**: Familiar patterns, great IDE support, minimal configuration

## Current State (v0.1.0)

🚧 **Experimental** - Early adopters welcome, not production-ready

**What Works:**
- ✅ Code generation for TypeScript and Python
- ✅ Type-safe event capture with autocomplete
- ✅ JSON Schema with $ref resolution and allOf merging
- ✅ Three validation modes (STRICT, WARNING, DISABLED)
- ✅ CLI tools for init and generation
- ✅ Examples for React, Node, Browser, Python
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation

**What's Missing:**
- ⚠️ Limited validation (only required fields and enums)
- ⚠️ Python CLI tests failing (4/8)
- ⚠️ Complex nested types return `any`/`Any`
- ⚠️ No watch mode or development tools
- ⚠️ No API reference documentation

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
- **Schema Complexity**: Very complex schemas may generate unmanageable code
  - *Mitigation*: Implement schema simplification, modular generation
- **Bundle Size**: Generated code could bloat applications
  - *Mitigation*: Tree-shaking, code splitting, lazy loading
- **Breaking Changes**: JSON Schema evolution could break generation
  - *Mitigation*: Pin schema version, provide migration tools

### Market Risks
- **PostHog Changes**: PostHog API changes could break HogTyped
  - *Mitigation*: Version compatibility matrix, automated testing
- **Low Adoption**: Developers may not see value in type safety
  - *Mitigation*: Focus on DX, quick wins, clear documentation
- **Competition**: Other type-safe analytics tools emerge
  - *Mitigation*: Move fast, build community, focus on quality

### Community Risks
- **Maintainer Burnout**: Open-source maintenance is demanding
  - *Mitigation*: Build contributor community, clear governance
- **Feature Creep**: Too many features dilute focus
  - *Mitigation*: Clear roadmap, prioritization framework, say no
- **Support Burden**: More users = more support requests
  - *Mitigation*: Great docs, FAQ, community forum, automation
